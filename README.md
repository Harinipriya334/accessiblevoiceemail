# accessiblevoiceemail
This project develops a voice-activated email system to assist visually impaired individuals in composing, sending, and reading emails using voice commands, enhancing accessibility and independence.
Aims to develop and evaluate a voice-activated email system designed to assist people with visual impairments in accessing and composing emails independently. The system uses speech recognition and natural language processing (NLP) technologies to allow users to perform email-related tasks such as composing, sending, and reading emails purely through voice commands. The study focuses on improving accessibility, enhancing usability, and providing a seamless user experience for visually impaired individuals. The goal is to make email communication more inclusive and empower users to interact with digital platforms without relying on traditional screen-based devices.

Key features of the project include:

Voice-based email composition and reading.
Integration with email providers (such as Gmail or Outlook).
Customizable voice commands for a user-friendly experience.
A focus on accessibility and ease of use for individuals with varying degrees of visual impairment.
